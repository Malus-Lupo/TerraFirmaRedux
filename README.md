# TerraFirmaRedux
Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod Pack based off TerraFirmaCraft.

Right now I am only looking for help with the cooking script. Recipes can be added easily by opening the game, 
going into creative, opening the Chef Workstation, and pressing the creative mode button.

There are 2 kinds of recipes to avoid/make. Food recipes should be as complex as possible, 
there should not be any premade parts to the food unless it makes IRL since for there to be. 
IE in real live you would not make peanut butter while you make a pb&j sandwich. So a recipe to
make peanut butter makes since. How ever in pams there is a chicken sandwich, and a leafy 
chicken sandwich, for some reason you make the chicken sandwich first, then you craft it with 
lettuce to make the leafy chicken sandwich. This should not be the case. There should be 2 full
chicken sandwich recipes one with lettuce added to the end and one with out resulting in each sandwich.

Other foods like cooking oil, jelly, or bbq sauce can also have there own recipe.

Please keep the list of workstation recipes and removed recipes separate, and please only put removed recipes 
in if you also replaced the original recipe with a work station recipe.

Also if you wish to add old textures, I have a goal to replace every texture from this pack, with the equivalent TFC texture, where allowed. Only if the item or block should have that texture. Like iron gear from vanilla, bronze gear from thermal foundation, vanilla foods etc.
